# reminders-mac-os-remake

When learning, it's best to have a project. 
As a demonstration. I took a macOS app and converted it into HTML and CSS. During this, I practiced a few more advanced CSS things:
- **Flexbox**, 
- **CSS Grid**, 
- **relative units**, 
- **CSS variables**, 
- **SVG** etc. 
 
### This is my remake
